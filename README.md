Smart Campus Ecosystem (Paragraph Version)

The Smart Campus Ecosystem is a comprehensive web and mobile platform designed to digitally integrate students, faculty, and administrative staff under a unified system. It facilitates real-time communication, efficient management of academic and campus activities, and promotes a sustainable, technology-driven environment. The platform offers dedicated modules for students, faculty, and administrators. Students can view class schedules, assignments, attendance records, access course materials, grades, submit feedback, and raise service requests. Faculty members can upload study materials and assignments, manage attendance, submit grades, and send announcements and notifications. Administrators can efficiently manage users, departments, resource allocation, and facility bookings, while also generating analytical reports on attendance, usage, and performance. Additional features include a campus map with navigation, a smart notice board for event updates, integration with IoT devices for smart classrooms, secure login using JWT authentication or Google Sign-In, and cloud database integration via MongoDB Atlas.
